## üìù Notes

* All sprite images used **must** have **Read/Write** checked in their import settings to avoid errors.
* It is recommended that the button be a child of the `UIAdView` component for proper functioning.
* Also, make sure to reference the button in the `adButtons` field of the `UIAdView` component via the Inspector.
